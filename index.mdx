## **ðŸŽ¯ What Are Options?**

Now imagine people in this market start placing **bets** on where prices will go. These bets are:

- **Call Options** â€“ betting the price goes **up**
- **Put Options** â€“ betting the price goes **down**

Most of these bets are sold by market makers, who then must **hedge** â€” adjust their own positions to avoid losing money as the stock price moves.
