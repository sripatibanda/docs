title: "üéØ Why Use GEX-Based Trading?"
description: "GEX-based strategies are not about predicting price ‚Äî they‚Äôre about anticipating market maker behavior. That makes them powerful in uncertain times."
---

GEX-based trading identifies key zones of dealer hedging. These zones often act as **support/resistance** or **price magnets**, influencing stock behavior near expirations. This makes GEX a powerful indicator for timing trades, managing risk, and spotting opportunities.

## **üîπ Graph 1: Strike Price vs Gamma Exposure**

**Purpose**: Identify strike prices where market makers may have the highest hedging sensitivity.

- **X-axis**: Strike Price ‚Äî the price at which the option can be exercised.
- **Y-axis**: GEX (Gamma Exposure) ‚Äî reflects the impact of each strike on dealer hedging activity.
- **Facet**: Separates Call and Put options.
- **Vertical line**: Represents the current stock price (spot price).

**How to interpret**:

- Peaks in GEX suggest high hedging activity.
- High GEX at or near the spot price can indicate potential price "magnet" zones.
-

## **üîπ Graph 2: Moneyness vs Gamma Exposure**

**Purpose**: Show how far an option is from the current price and its gamma exposure.

- **X-axis**: Moneyness = (Strike / Spot Price) - 1
  - 0 means the strike is at-the-money (ATM)
  - Positive = Out-of-the-money for calls
  - Negative = In-the-money for calls (and reversed for puts)
- **Y-axis**: GEX
- **Facet**: Call and Put options separated
- **Vertical line**: At moneyness = 0 (ATM)

**How to interpret**:

- High GEX near moneyness 0 = market is sensitive to small price moves.
- GEX far from ATM shows deep OTM or ITM strikes affecting dealer exposure.

## **üîπ Graph 3: Top Option Spread Candidates by Score**

**Purpose**: Highlight top-scoring options for potential spreads.

- **X-axis**: Strike Price
- **Y-axis**: Composite Score ‚Äî an algorithmic measure combining factors like volume, spread, GEX, delta, etc.
- **Facet**: Call and Put options separated
- **Color**: Represents different stock symbols

**How to interpret**:

- Higher scores indicate more favorable or active option setups.
- Use this to identify opportunities in high-scoring strikes for each stock.

## **üìò Glossary**

- **Strike Price**: Set price for buying/selling the underlying stock.
- **Spot Price**: Current trading price of the stock.
- **GEX (Gamma Exposure)**: Indicates how much market makers need to adjust their positions based on option movement.
- **Moneyness**: Describes how far an option is from being profitable at current prices.
- **Call Option**: Bet on the stock going up.
- **Put Option**: Bet on the stock going down.

# **üìä Risk vs Reward: Expected PnL from Option Spread Candidates**

This plot visualizes potential trades by comparing **expected returns** versus **risk exposure** for each option spread. It helps traders evaluate which opportunities offer the most favorable reward-to-risk profiles.

---

## **üîç Key Definitions**

- **Expected PnL**: Approximated as the product of Gamma Exposure (GEX) and last option price. This gives a proxy for how profitable a trade might be if GEX plays out.
- **Capital at Risk (wth)**: A measure of how much capital is exposed in the trade (e.g., max loss or cost basis).

---

## **üìà Graph Overview**

- **X-axis**: Capital at Risk (`wth`) ‚Äî how much money is needed or potentially at stake.
- **Y-axis**: Expected PnL ‚Äî the estimated reward of the trade.
- **Color**: Option type (`call` in blue, `put` in red).
- **Hover Info**: Shows symbol, strike, expiry, and time to maturity for each candidate.

Two reference lines are drawn:

- **Horizontal Line at Y=0**: Separates profitable (above line) vs. unprofitable (below line) expected outcomes.
- **Vertical Line at X=0**: Helps visualize negative vs. positive capital risk (though negative risk is rare or invalid in practice).

---

## **üß† How to Use This Plot**

- Points in the **top-left** quadrant: High reward, low risk ‚Äî ideal trades.
- Points in the **top-right** quadrant: Higher reward but also higher risk ‚Äî possible depending on risk appetite.
- Points **below the horizontal line**: Negative expected value ‚Äî typically avoid.
- Use this view to **rank opportunities** by both potential profit and required capital exposure.

---

## **‚úÖ Why This Matters**

This visualization supports GEX-based strategies by grounding them in **risk/reward logic**, helping you filter for trades with both gamma tailwinds and attractive financial setup. It enables you to:

- Compare spreads across different tickers and strikes.
- Prioritize trades with better efficiency (more return per unit of risk).
- Spot outliers where GEX is high but capital risk is manageable.
